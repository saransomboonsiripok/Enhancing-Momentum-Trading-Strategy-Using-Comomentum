# Enhancing-Momentum-Trading-Strategy-Using-Comomentum
This project enhances a standard momentum trading strategy by integrating "comomentum" to predict momentum performance more effectively. Using U.S. equity data and the Fama-French model, both standard and comomentum-adjusted momentum factors were analyzed, showing improved returns and risk-adjusted performance through Fama-MacBeth regression.
